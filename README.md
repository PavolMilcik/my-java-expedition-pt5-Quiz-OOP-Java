# Part 5 - QUIZ :question::grey_question:	
My simple **Quiz** in OOP using Java. I am using **Maven** as the build system.

##

### I have created a simple quiz with the following properties:

- This quiz offers 2 options.
  
- You can choose from Math quiz, and/or Geography quiz.
  
- Each quiz contains 3 questions.
  
- Questions can have a single answer or multiple answers.

- At the start of the quiz, the first player chooses a name.
  
- At the end of the first player's game, there will be a summary of their correct answers.
  
- Then the second player starts the quiz.
  
- After the second player finishes, the correct answers of both players are compared, and the game determines the winner.
